# Automatic phytolith classification by means of feature extraction and several classifiers
This software can be used for extracting morphological and geometric features from phytoliths images.

The code is divided into two Jupyter Notebooks:

- ```Exploration_DataGeneration.ipynb```: Generates the dataset from phytoliths images and their masks.
- ```Perform_Experiments.ipynb```: Performs the experimentation with the dataset created by the previous notebook.
